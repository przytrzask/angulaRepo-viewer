# githubAPI 
##### For recruitment purposes
- live demo http://przytrzask.usermd.net/githubapiforscalac/app/#/

### How to use
First You need to generate own auth keys.
There is an UI instruction on 'about it' page :smile:
### Thanks
To Scalac for inviting me to do this task. It is always productive
### Chosen technologies
Since Angular is an example repo, I decided to use angular which I am still learnig and to try for the first time angular material design, because I was curious about that.
### Problems
Altought the task was clear I had some troubles with github api documentation.
It takes time to manage desired data.
### Bugs
 Acoording to previous point. I tried to use sort on server side but eventually it seems there is no such option so i did it locally but it works only on current page
### TODOS
Due to impossibility of sorting on server side have to fetch all data together using $q.all promise

### Final words
I would be very grateful for any kind of feedback and criticism. Please consider that with my lack of experience I am rather suitable for junior position but I am ambitious and will do my best to jump at the chance.
